# Technical interviews
## Big take away:
- Don't just right in!
- Don't code silently!
- Treat your interviewer as a potential co-worker// ask if there's annything you're missing at the beginning// ask for help if you're stuck

---
- Be clear in what you know and don't know.
- Treat interviewer as a coworker. Ask a Q if you're stuck.
- Take a minute to process the Q.
- Give exmpale input/out to confirm this what is should do.
  - Use assert statement as a way to test your code (TDD)
- Come up with some edge cases
- Ask: "Before I start writing my code, is there anything else that I should consider?"; "Do you think there is anything that I am missing?"
- Pseudocode the steps
- Check in as you go... how does this approach seam to you?
- May have a Q about time/space complexity & how to improve your code
---
- If an interviewer gives you a tip, accept their tip
- **Read error message aloud**
- Can ask at the beginning: "Do I need to worry about validation? Or should I assume valid input?"
- Solve meat of the problem first; can leave comments at start that you would validate, and go back to code that if you have time.
- Time/space complexity- will likely be asked about this
- If you don't know where to start... try it out without code first
- **repl.it** has a debugger


---
- Start of by making sure you understand the Q
- Make some more examples of inputs/outputs, check with interviewer if they are correct
- Once verbally state your idea check if you're good to start coding the soution
- Write out some pseudo-code
- Don't focus on edge cases

---
Side note:

**look up: .find()**  
The find() method finds the first occurrence of the specified value.

The find() method returns -1 if the value is not found.

The find() method is almost the same as the **index()** method, the only difference is that the index() method raises an exception if the value is not found.

## Non-technical sample Q's to ask your interviewer:
- How do Ada values manifest on your team/in your company?
- What do you like best about working this job?
- How does the team work together? support eachother?


## How to practice for interviews:
- Re-do past PSEs with a timer.
- Explain the code to someoone else.
## Some fun ways to practice coding (not for interviews):
- https://glitch.com/
- Make a vision board (example place to do this: https://www.are.na/)
- [The missing semester of your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
