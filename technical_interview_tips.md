#Technical interviews

- Start of by making sure you understand the Q
- Make some more examples of inputs/outputs, check with interviewer if they are correct
- Once verbally state your idea check if you're good to start coding the soution
- Write out some pseudo-code
- Don't focus on edge cases

Side note:

**look up: .find()**  
The find() method finds the first occurrence of the specified value.

The find() method returns -1 if the value is not found.

The find() method is almost the same as the **index()** method, the only difference is that the index() method raises an exception if the value is not found.

## Non-technical sample Q's to ask your interviewer:
- How do Ada values manifest on your team/in your company?
- What do you like best about working this job?
- How does the team work together? support eachother?
