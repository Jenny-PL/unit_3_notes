## Resume tips


1. show, don't tell.  Notes from a hiring manager: 

When your resume mentions technologies, frameworks and libraries that impact my team, it peaks my attention.

But, then when there's no bullet point to back it up I throw it to the side.

Here's a bad bullet point:

`Used Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize.js on the backend, and React on the front-end with Redux for state management.`

Why is this bad?

My rule is: **show, don't tell.**

Here's a good example:
`Designed database using ACID properties and used Sequelize ORM to set-up validations and constraints for 6 data models and ensured integrity of the data model by writing unit tests for all model queries, validations and constraints.`

If you go back to your bootcamp lectures and the documentation for the libraries you're working with, you'll find the principles you should be talking about in a resume bullet point, that you were inherently following at bootcamp but didn't know what to call it.
