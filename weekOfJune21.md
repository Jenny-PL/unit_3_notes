# Q's for office hours:
- How is setState() an API? What is an API really?? [react doc calling setState an API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle)

- [Can someone explain closures to me?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript#closures)

- State&Event Handling Learn HW. Updating State. Why doesn't this work: (in Student.js)
```
 {/* why can't I display value of isPresent?  See below */}
      <p>{isPresent}</p> 
```
- General Q: Do we only want one container component (manage/hold data)? (the single sources of truth) Should everything else just be presentational components? (display only)
